**These are some of my personal picked series and movies that I love because I found them very interesting, especially The Hhunger Games, which I consider as my comfort movies.**

*The Hunger Games* - **This is really close to my heart since I was a child, I remmeber I even bought a book of all of the parts of it because I can't wait and my anticipation is already killing me if I wait for another making of the movie, it talks about the politics and how they fought with it**

*Grease* - **I love this movie, it is such a classic movie that features both of the biggest star we know right now. It is a musicl movie that covers how a love story started by two lovers and meeting unexpectedly in such various place**

*The Notebook* - **This is my picked movie if I want to pour out my eyes and just cry my heart out. It it a classic movie of Rachel McAdams and a novel by sir Nicholas, a great novel and a movie.**
